## challenges i faced
- **Drag and drop** - wrestling with the drag and drop api forced me to understand the whats, whys, and hows of events in javascript. 
- **Firebase** - this was my first foray into third-party apis. Getting used to reading documentation and learning how to mesh my code with firebase was definitely a learning experience.
